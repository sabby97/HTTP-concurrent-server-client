This is a basic server that can handle multiple requests from clients.

Every time a request is sent to the server the program forks over a child process to handle it.

To compile the program make sure you are in the correct directory and just type make.

When running the program make sure to add port number as an argument. For example: ./server.o 8888

The program is explained thoroughly in the comments if you open the server.c file.
